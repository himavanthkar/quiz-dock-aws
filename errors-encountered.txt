# Errors Encountered During Setup and Troubleshooting

## MongoDB Issues

1. **MongoDB Port Already in Use**
   - Error: `Address already in use` for port 27017
   - Solution: Killed existing MongoDB processes with `pkill -f mongod` and restarted MongoDB with `mongod --dbpath ~/data/db --fork --logpath ~/data/db/mongodb.log`

## Backend API Issues

1. **Route Order Issue in userRoutes.js**
   - Error: `Cast to ObjectId failed for value "me" (type string) at path "_id" for model "User"`
   - Solution: Reordered routes in `routes/userRoutes.js` to ensure `/me` routes are defined before the `/:id` route to prevent Express from treating "me" as an ID parameter

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Error: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001`
   - Solution: Killed existing Node.js processes with `pkill -f "node.*server.js"` before starting the server again

3. **Attempts API Error**
   - Error: `GET /api/attempts 400 X.XXX ms - 84` and `Error getting attempts: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reduce')`
   - Solution: 
     - The backend was finding attempts but encountering an error when processing them
     - Fixed by adding proper data processing in the getMyAttempts controller function:
       - Added code to convert Mongoose documents to plain JavaScript objects
       - Added null checks for percentageScore, passed status, and answers array
       - Ensured default values are provided for missing properties
     - Updated the Dashboard.js file to handle potential undefined values:
       - Added checks to ensure quizzes and attempts are arrays
       - Added null checks for user properties
       - Added null checks for quiz properties
       - Added null checks for attempt properties
       - Improved the reduce functions to handle missing properties

## Frontend Issues

1. **Proxy Configuration Issue**
   - Error: No response after submitting login credentials
   - Solution: Updated the proxy in `frontend/package.json` from `http://localhost:5000` to `http://localhost:5001` to match the actual backend port

2. **Axios Configuration Issue**
   - Error: API calls not reaching the backend
   - Solution: Created a custom axios configuration in `frontend/src/utils/index.js` to set the base URL to `http://localhost:5001` and updated imports in context files

3. **Error Display Issue**
   - Error: Login errors not visible to the user
   - Solution: Added direct error display in the Login component to show authentication errors

4. **Port Conflict**
   - Error: "Something is already running on port 3000"
   - Solution: Killed existing React development server processes with `pkill -f "react-scripts start"` and restarted the frontend or accepted the prompt to use a different port

## Authentication Issues

1. **Missing Demo Users**
   - Error: Demo credentials shown on the login page didn't work
   - Solution: Created the demo user accounts in the database using the API:
     - Created TestUser account
     - Created Harry Potter demo account
     - Created Albus Dumbledore demo account

2. **Login Credentials Issue**
   - Error: "Invalid credentials" when trying to log in
   - Solution: Verified that the following credentials work correctly on the backend:
     - Harry Potter: Email: harry@hogwarts.edu, Password: gryffindor123
     - TestUser: Email: test@example.com, Password: password123
     - NewUser: Email: new@example.com, Password: password123
   - If frontend login still fails, try clearing browser cache or using incognito mode

3. **Authorization Issue**
   - Error: "Not authorized to access this route" after successful login
   - Solution: 
     - Updated the token handling in `setAuthToken.js` to ensure it's properly stored in localStorage
     - Enhanced the `loadUser` function in `AuthContext.js` to better handle token verification
     - Updated the `login` function to explicitly set the token in localStorage and axios headers
     - Modified the `App.js` file to check for token on initial load
     - Added debugging to the `PrivateRoute` component to better handle authentication state

4. **Login Failure Issue**
   - Error: Login fails silently or with "Invalid credentials" even with correct credentials
   - Solution: 
     - Enhanced token handling in `setAuthToken.js` with better validation and error handling
     - Improved the login function in `AuthContext.js` to clear existing tokens before login attempts
     - Added more detailed logging throughout the authentication process
     - Updated the App.js initialization to properly check for tokens on startup
     - Added proper error handling for token validation failures
     - Implemented better error messages for authentication failures

## Other Issues

1. **ESLint Warning**
   - Warning: `'error' is assigned a value but never used` in Register.js
   - Solution: This is a minor warning that doesn't affect functionality, but could be fixed by either using the error variable or removing it from destructuring 

2. **Unused Variable Warning**
   - Warning: `'navigate' is assigned a value but never used` in Dashboard.js
   - Solution: This is a minor warning that doesn't affect functionality, but could be fixed by either using the navigate variable or removing it from destructuring

## Quiz Functionality Issues

1. **Attempts API Error**
   - Error: `GET /api/attempts 400 2.626 ms - 84` when trying to view quiz attempts
   - Solution: 
     - Fixed route imports in server.js to ensure the attemptRoutes are properly loaded
     - Added better error handling in the getMyAttempts controller function
     - Ensured authentication is properly passed to the API

2. **How Correct Answers Work**
   - The quiz application stores the correct answer index in the `rightAnswer` field of each question
   - When a user submits an answer, the `submitAnswer` function in `attemptController.js` compares the selected choice index with the `rightAnswer` index
   - If they match, the answer is marked as correct and points are awarded
   - The result is returned to the frontend, which displays feedback to the user
   - When the quiz is completed, all answers are saved in the attempt record and statistics are calculated

3. **Quiz Results Display**
   - After completing a quiz, the results page shows:
     - Overall score and pass/fail status
     - A breakdown of each question
     - The user's selected answer
     - The correct answer
     - Points earned for each question
   - This information is retrieved from the saved attempt record in the database 

## UI Functionality Issues

1. **Edit and Delete Quiz Options Not Working**
   - Error: Edit and delete options were not properly displayed or functioning in the QuizDetails and Dashboard pages
   - Solution:
     - Fixed the isOwner check in QuizDetails.js to handle both object and string creator IDs
     - Added proper error handling for delete operations
     - Added delete button in the Dashboard.js file
     - Improved the UI layout for the action buttons
     - Added proper error display for failed operations 

2. **Process Management Issues**
   - Error: Multiple instances of the server and frontend running simultaneously causing port conflicts
     - `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001`
     - `Something is already running on port 3000`
   - Solution:
     - Before starting the application, always kill all existing processes:
       ```bash
       # Kill all Node.js server processes
       pkill -f "node.*server.js"
       
       # Kill all React development server processes
       pkill -f "react-scripts start"
       
       # Wait a moment for processes to terminate
       sleep 2
       
       # Start the application
       npm run dev
       ```
     - If the above doesn't work, try more aggressive process termination:
       ```bash
       # Find process IDs using ports 5001 and 3000
       lsof -i :5001
       lsof -i :3000
       
       # Kill processes by PID
       kill -9 <PID>
       ```
     - For macOS users, you can also use Activity Monitor to find and force quit Node.js processes
     - As a last resort, restart your computer to clear all hanging processes
